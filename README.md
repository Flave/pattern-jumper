Jumper
======

A tiny sublime text 2 plugin which allows you to jump to a specific comment section (or any section) in a file. All you have to do to create a section is marking it with a certain 'identifier string'. The default identifier string is `//  ` (notice the two spaces after the //). After the identifier string you can add the title of your section `//  HEADER`. Now you can jump to this section any time by pressing `alt+cmd+j` and typing the first letters of your section name. This makes navigation inside a scss file or js super easy.
